# Trees-related
This will be a repo of algorithns pertaining tress
1. xgboost 
2. catboost will be done soon

Note: 
1. Due to the viewing difficulty in notebook, the best part of the CatBoost, which is its nice training plot, together with other nice stuff as pandas profiling, just cannot render properly, you need to run yourself in a good kernel platform to see!
2. The cropped graphs have been added as the PDF file 1.pdf to show the nice stuff I have mentioned above.
